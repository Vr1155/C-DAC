What is the need of binary trees?

Linked list is a linear DS and only allows linear search.
Binary search is a performance optimization over linear search.
Therefore, binary search trees are better way to store data if,
searching data efficiently is a high priority.

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, 
except possibly the last, is completely filled, 
and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. 
It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes at the last level h. 
A complete binary tree can be efficiently represented as an array.

A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which 
all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level 
(the level of a node defined as the number of edges or links from the root node to a node). 
A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree.
A perfect tree is therefore always complete but a complete tree is not always perfect.
