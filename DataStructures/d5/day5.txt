======================================

linux binary executable: .elf format
e = executable
l = linkable
f = format

windows have a different executable file format.
C compiler has to generate different executable for different platforms.
Therefore it is said that C is a platform dependent language.

Incase "ulimit -c" command does not work, use:
$gcc -g filename.c
$gdb -q a.out

Once gdb shell opens start debugging main by typing:
b main
r

Then just type:
n

to jump to next breakpoint (line by line),
eventually you will reach the line that gives the segfault
