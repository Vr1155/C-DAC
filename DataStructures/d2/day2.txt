Day 2:

---> Yesterday
===============

In any problem solving 
3 statements are very important.
------> Sequential
------> conditional branching
------> looping/iterative constructs (aka goto statements)

We use functions as a means to organize our code by dividing the task/program into sub tasks/programs.

Let us understand the usages of these functions
----> Different syntaxes can be used in function
	----> functions taking no arguments returning nothing
	----> functions taking no arguments returning something
	----> functions taking arguments returning something

----> We will try to understand the working of functions (flow of control)
	----> Always remember your program starts with main() and ends with main()...
	----> see fun.c for learning about control flow in functions.
	----> see recur.c for learning about recursion and its similarities with iterative loops

----> Using recursion:
1. Factorial of a number
2. Power of number raise to number.
3. Fibonacci number.
4. Reversing anarray.
5. Tower of hanoi.
